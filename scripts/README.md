# Scripts

### To Download data
1. Download ```File_import.R``` and ```RunR.sh``` scripts and save them to the **same location**.
2. Navigate to the folder where the script ```RunR.sh``` is saved.
2. Ensure you have a data folder outside the folder where the script is saved. If not, this command when run from bash(from the ```RunR.sh``` location) should create the data Folder - ```mkdir ..\data```
3. Run the following command - ```bash RunR.sh```
4. Data can now be found as ```raw_data.csv``` in the data folder

```Data_EDA.ipynb``` creates a codebook currently.
