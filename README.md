# Exploration of Mental health survey Dataset

There is an increase in cases of mental illness on a global scale. Mental health problems are slowly becoming one of the top contributors for disease and disability across the world. Cases of mental illness can be found across developing as well as developed nations. They are present among the across different age groups, social strata as well as gender. Tech companies are rapidly growing in number and size and this means there is more pressure on it's workers to perform. This pressure could have negative implications on a few individuals and before they realize could lead to mental illness.

In this analysis I look at mental health survey data of workers across the globe to determine if the tech companies are doing enough to ensure mental wellbeing of their workers. This includes a positive working environment, right tools to cope with stress and awareness of mental illness and it's symptoms.

## Hypothesis

My hypothesis for this analysis is -
- **Null hypothesis**: Tech companies are well equipped and are not responsible for mental illness among their employees.
- **Alternate hypothesis**: Tech companies play a role in mental illness of workers and if so, provide employees adequate support to overcome this illness.

## Why this analysis?

There is a boom in the number of startups in the tech industry, as well as growth of the existing tech giants. They are looking to outdo each other and hire workers who can get them to the top. This sometimes comes at a cost of the mental health of it's employees. As someone who is aspiring to work for a tech company I want to analyze the response of these companies to mental illness.
