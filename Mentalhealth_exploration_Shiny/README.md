# Shiny application

Link to Shiny application: https://amurali.shinyapps.io/Mentalhealth_exploration_Shiny/

This application was built in course requirement for DSCI 532 - Data visualization.

In this app, I try to explore the importance that companies dedicate to mental health and the resources they offer to the employers. I also try to delve into the factors that might help predict mental health problems among employers. I hope this tool can be used by employers and employee to make better decisions in regard to mental health.

`ui.R`: to build the user interface
`server.R`: to build server side logic
